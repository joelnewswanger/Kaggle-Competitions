This Kaggle competition was my capstone project in the Udacity machine learning nanodegree. My capstone project proposal and final report are included. The Jupyter notebook labeled SeedlingID contains the work I did for the capstone project and there is an html version of it also. The other two jupyter notebooks SeedlingID 2 & 3 are further work I have done since to improve my ranking in the competition.
